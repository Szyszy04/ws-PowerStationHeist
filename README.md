# ws-PowerStationHeist
Small power plant heist for FiveM. The config file allows for extensive editing of the heist without the need for programming knowledge!

The heist requires:
ws-lockpick
ox_target
ox_lib
ox_inventory 

The target.lua file contains a place to place a notification for PD according to your needs.
The definition of the 'sheet' item and its function should be placed in the appropriate ox_inventory files.
